\MYTITLE{Lab 5\\23 September 2015\\
Due Wednesday, 30 September by 2:30pm }

\subsection*{Objectives}
\vspace{-0.05in}

In addition to practicing the skills that you have learned in the past laboratory assignments, the purpose of this
assignment is to further explore the ideas of a ``class'' and an ``object'' in the Java programming language.
Additionally, you will learn how to use the methods provided by the {\tt java.lang.String} class to inspect and
manipulate a {\tt String} object. You will apply your knowledge of {\tt String}s to the application domain of
steganography, the practice of ``hiding'' messages inside of non-secret content. Finally, you will work in a team to
complete a real-world programming task, using tools like Git and Slack to support your collaborative completion of the
assignment.

\subsection*{General Guidelines for Labs}
\vspace{-0.05in}
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf Work on the Alden Hall computers.} If you want to work on a different
machine, be sure to transfer your programs to the Alden
machines and re-run them before submitting.
\item
{\bf Update your repository often!} You should add, commit,
and push your updated files each time you work on them.  I will not grade
your programs until the due date has passed.
\item
{\bf Review the Honor Code policy.} You
may discuss programs with others, but programs that are nearly identical
to others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reading Assignment}
\vspace{-0.05in}

To review that you have already learned about about variables, expressions, and user input, please review Sections
2.1--2.6 in your textbook; pay close attention to the {\tt Scanner} methods in Figure 2.7 and the program in Listing
2.8. To learn more about Java classes and objects and, in particular, the methods provided by the {\tt java.lang.String}
class, please review Sections 3.1--3.2 in the textbook. Finally, don't forget to examine the ``Git Cheatsheet'' if you
have questions about how to create and use a new Git repository. Please see the instructor if you have questions
about these readings.

\subsection*{Required Deliverables}

In addition to submitting signed and printed versions of all materials, for this assignment you are invited to submit
electronic versions of the following deliverables through the Bitbucket repository. As you complete this step, you
should make sure that you created a {\tt lab5/} directory within your own Git repository.  Then, you can save all of the
required deliverables in the {\tt lab5/} directory---please see the course instructor or a teaching assistant if you are
not able to create your directory properly. Additionally, you and your partner should have created a separate repository
to support the completion of this assignment; it should also contain a {\tt lab5/} directory with all of the
deliverables that you collaboratively created for this assignment. Finally, please make sure that your team creates a
Slack channel that you can use to support all of your communication for this assignment.

\begin{enumerate}

        \item A completed, properly commented and formatted {\tt WordHide.java} program. Please make sure that your Java
          programs include the comment header file with the Honor Code, your name, date, and the description of the
          program.

        \item An output (your drawing) from running {\tt Lab4Display} in the terminal window. You can take a screenshot
          of your output, paste it into another software application (e.g., LibreOffice or gimp) and save it. Please see
          the instructor or a teaching assistant if you have questions about creating an electronic version of your
          output or saving it in Bitbucket.

\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-0.1in}

Share your program and the output file with me through your Git repository by correctly using ``{\tt git add}'', ``{\tt
git commit}'', and ``{\tt git push}'' commands. When you are done, please ensure that the Bitbucket Web site has a {\tt
lab4/} directory in your repository with only the three files called {\tt WordHide.java}, {\tt output}, and {\tt
team\_roles}. You should review the ``Git Cheatsheet'' and see the course instructor if you have questions about assignment
submission using the {\tt git} commands.
